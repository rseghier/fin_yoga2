It features a diverse range of classes including dynamic vinyasa, relaxing yin, and specialized sessions such as pre-natal yoga. The instructors are well-regarded for their professionalism and personal approach, ensuring that each student receives the attention they need. The studio has a lovely aesthetic and is equipped with clean facilities, including spacious changing rooms and showers. While the variety of classes and multilingual instruction (Czech and English) are definite pluses, there are concerns about overcrowding during peak times, which can detract from the overall experience.
