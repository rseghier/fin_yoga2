# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio is nestled in the stunning natural surroundings of Tulum, offering a beautiful and relaxing atmosphere that many find appealing. The diversity of yoga classes and styles is a highlight, with experienced instructors providing quality sessions. However, the studio has received criticism for class information clarity, particularly for beginners who may struggle with intermediate-level classes without proper cues. While the facilities themselves, including equipment and ambiance, are praised, there is a notable gap in the staff's ability to create a welcoming experience for hotel guests. Some reviews pointed to inconsistencies in class descriptions and a lack of personalized service, which could impact the overall experience for those new to yoga.
