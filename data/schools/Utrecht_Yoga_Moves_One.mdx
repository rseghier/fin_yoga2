# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio offers a variety of classes and is appreciated for its good teachers and welcoming atmosphere. Many students find the classes beneficial, especially for specific needs like back care. However, the studio has been criticized for certain operational aspects like its app-based registration system, which users find customer-unfriendly, and the strict credit expiration policy. The environment can feel somewhat impersonal due to the studio's larger size, though this also allows for a broader range of classes. Teachers like Daniela are noted for their expertise and engaging teaching style, making the experience enjoyable despite the drawbacks mentioned.

Overall, students enjoy the diversity of classes and the quality of instruction, though issues related to class administration have led to dissatisfaction for some.
