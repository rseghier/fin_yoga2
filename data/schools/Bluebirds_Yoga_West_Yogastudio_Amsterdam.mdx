# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio is known for its variety of classes including Vinyasa, Yoga Nidra, and Pilates, attracting a loyal customer base. However, recent overcrowding has negatively impacted the experience, as mats are placed very close together, making it difficult for practitioners to relax and focus. While some classes are praised for their instructors, particularly for their attention to proper breathing and personal support, concerns have been raised about the cleanliness and maintenance of the space, particularly with dust accumulation and poor ventilation. Customers have expressed discomfort with the atmosphere, noting it lacks positive energy, possibly due to close proximity to others and lack of accountability from management regarding concerns raised. Some classes, particularly prenatal ones, have drawn criticism for the intensity of exercises that may not be suitable for all attendees. Despite these challenges, the studio has potential, and certain instructors are highlighted for their exceptional teaching abilities.
