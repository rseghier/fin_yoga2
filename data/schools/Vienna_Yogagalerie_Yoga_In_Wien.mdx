# Studio Presentation

The studio offers basic training facilities with a small changing room, a bathroom without a shower, and a training room that accommodates about 15 people. While the atmosphere is generally pleasant, the entrance area and hallways are affected by smoke from other renters, leading to an uncomfortable experience for visitors. The instructors are friendly, although there are changes in staffing from time to time. Specific classes, such as the Mama Baby yoga course, have faced criticism due to the arrangement for handling crying babies, which has led to a decline in attendance. Overall, the studio has a cozy yet basic feel, which may not suit everyone's needs.

Some visitors have noted practical issues regarding accessibility, especially for mothers with strollers, which detracts from the experience. Noise and safety concerns in navigating the facility with small children have been mentioned too.
