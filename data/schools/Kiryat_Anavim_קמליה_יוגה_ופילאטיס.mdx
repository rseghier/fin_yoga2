# Studio Presentation

This studio is described as beautiful and inviting, offering a range of yoga and pilates classes. However, the experience of a potential new client was marred by strict policies regarding liability waivers before participation in classes, which required signing a document that placed all responsibility for safety on the participant. This policy raised concerns about the accountability of the studio regarding equipment, particularly concerning the safety of the hammocks used in classes. While the studio appears to emphasize safety and client responsibility, this approach can discourage newcomers who might find the waiver process off-putting. Ultimately, the inability to address these concerns in writing led to a disappointing experience for some visitors.

Overall, the studio seems to create a pleasant atmosphere for physical practice but has operational policies that may need reassessment to ensure a welcoming environment for all.
