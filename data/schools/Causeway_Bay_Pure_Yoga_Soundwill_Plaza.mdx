# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio is conveniently located just opposite Times Square in Causeway Bay, making it easily accessible for visitors. The atmosphere is enhanced by the professionalism and synergy of the yoga teachers, who are highly regarded by the clients. However, the facilities are somewhat outdated, with specific issues noted in the female changing room, such as a lack of showers and cleanliness concerns. Despite these weaknesses, the studio remains a popular choice due to its prime location.

While the teaching quality is praised, the state of the changing facilities and overall cleanliness may require attention to enhance the overall experience for practitioners.
