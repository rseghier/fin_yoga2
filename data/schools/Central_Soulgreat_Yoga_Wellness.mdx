# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio is located in a vibrant area and is noted for its beautiful environment and great instructors. Customers appreciate the patience and friendliness of the teachers, especially for beginners looking to start their yoga journey. However, there have been multiple reports of class cancellations via ClassPass, often on short notice, leading to disappointment among clients. The management of the studio has been criticized for its handling of cancellations and communication with clients. Additionally, the studio is on the third floor of the building, and there is no elevator, which could be inconvenient for some visitors. Overall, while the instruction quality is praised, the management and booking processes need significant improvement.
