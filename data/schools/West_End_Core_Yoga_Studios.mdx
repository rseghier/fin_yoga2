# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio was previously operational in West End, QLD, offering a range of yoga classes to its community. As of late 2022, the studio closed down its regular classes but has reportedly transitioned to running retreats and other events. The closure of daily classes may have affected the community's access to regular yoga practice, although the studio continues to provide opportunities for yoga through special events.

Despite the changes, it appears that the studio remains engaged in promoting wellness through its retreat offerings. However, those looking for consistent and weekly classes may need to look elsewhere.

- Has a history of providing yoga classes

## Areas for Improvement
