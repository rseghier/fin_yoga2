# Studio Presentation

The studio is located in Vitacura, Santiago Metropolitan Region. Several reviews indicate a serious issue with cancellations, specifically noting that classes can be canceled just minutes before they are scheduled to start. This has led to dissatisfaction among clients who found themselves unnotified and waiting outside the venue, resulting in a poor experience. It seems that communication regarding schedule changes is lacking, which negatively affects the reliability and trustworthiness of the studio.

Overall, the reviews emphasize that while the location may be appealing, the management's handling of cancellations needs significant improvement to enhance client satisfaction.
