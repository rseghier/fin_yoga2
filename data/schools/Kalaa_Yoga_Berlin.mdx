# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio offers a variety of classes, including prenatal and postnatal yoga, creating a welcoming and cozy environment for participants. The instructors are knowledgeable and attentive to the specific needs of their students, ensuring a nurturing atmosphere. Many participants appreciate the small class sizes and the dedication of the staff. Outdoor yoga sessions in the garden during warmer months are also a highlight. However, the studio has faced criticism for a lack of effective communication and inclusivity, especially for non-German speakers, which can detract from the overall experience. While the studio has strong points in professionalism and community feel, it has been noted that some classes may not fully cater to an international audience, sometimes leading to feelings of exclusion.
