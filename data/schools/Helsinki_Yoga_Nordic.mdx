# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio in Helsinki offers a variety of classes and is noted for its nice atmosphere and friendly instructors. However, many reviews highlight significant issues, including unfriendly staff and a business-oriented approach, which contradicts the essence of yoga. Clients expressed dissatisfaction with hidden costs, as they are required to pay for mats and towels unless they bring their own. The studio was also criticized for being overcrowded, leading to a negative experience for attendees. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding misleading hours of operation and lack of communication from the staff, which adds to the frustration of visitors.

Overall, while there are some positive aspects such as well-led classes and a pleasant environment, the negative experiences surrounding service and transparency significantly detract from the overall value.
