# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio offers spacious facilities with high ceilings and well-designed locker rooms. However, the overall experience is marred by poor customer service and cleanliness issues. Staff are frequently described as rude, condescending, and overly aggressive in promoting membership packages. Several reviews highlight troubling behaviors from both the front desk and housekeeping, leading to a negative atmosphere. The instructors vary in effectiveness, with some being knowledgeable while others display inappropriate conduct in class. Many clients expressed dissatisfaction with the management's apparent disregard for service quality and hygiene standards, resulting in a recommendation not to return. While the spaciousness of the place is appreciated, the lack of professionalism among the staff and instructors heavily detracts from the overall yoga experience.
