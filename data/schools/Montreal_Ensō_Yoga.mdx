# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio in Montreal offers a variety of classes including Pilates and barre, with many experienced and friendly instructors. The facility is noted for its cleanliness and well-organized space, making it a welcoming environment for attendees. However, there are significant concerns regarding the overcrowded classes, often featuring 60 to 70 participants, which can lead to a chaotic atmosphere. Customers have noted a lack of personal attention due to the number of students. Moreover, the customer service experience tends to vary, with some praising the staff while others express disappointment in the responsiveness and professionalism. Pricing is considered high given the crowded conditions and some view the emphasis on profit over quality negatively. Despite these issues, dedicated members still enjoy the community feel and overall workout offerings, particularly in Pilates and barre.
