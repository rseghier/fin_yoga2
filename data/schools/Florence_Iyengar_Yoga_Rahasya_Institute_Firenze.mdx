# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio is situated in Florence and offers a unique approach to yoga with an emphasis on the Iyengar style. However, it has been noted that there are some accessibility issues for older adults, as the instructor does not accept students over the age of 60. This policy has raised concerns among potential students who believe yoga should be accessible to all ages. The initial promise of a free trial class is overshadowed by a mandatory registration fee, which diminishes the appeal for newcomers. Enthusiasts appreciate the philosophy of yoga for everyone but feel that the age restriction contradicts this idea, potentially alienating a segment of the community.


## Why You'll Love It

- Emphasis on the Iyengar yoga style.
- Potential for a strong community of dedicated practitioners.

## Areas for Improvement

- Age limit of 60 years for new students.
- Mandatory registration fee for trial classes.
- Concerns about accessibility for older adults.
