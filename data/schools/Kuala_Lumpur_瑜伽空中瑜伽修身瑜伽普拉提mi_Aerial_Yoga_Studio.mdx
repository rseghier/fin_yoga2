# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio offers a range of classes including Aerial Yoga and Pilates, aimed at promoting physical fitness and well-being. However, it has faced criticism for last-minute class cancellations, often only a few hours before the scheduled time, leaving students frustrated and without proper communication. Newcomers to Aerial Yoga have expressed a need for better guidance and support from instructors, particularly during challenging postures. It has been suggested that the studio could enhance the experience by organizing separate beginner sessions and ensuring instructors acknowledge first-timers at the start of classes to provide a welcoming atmosphere. Overall, while the studio offers interesting yoga styles, the management needs to improve class communication and instructor support.
