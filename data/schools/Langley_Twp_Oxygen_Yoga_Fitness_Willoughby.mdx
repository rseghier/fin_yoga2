# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio offers a range of classes but has faced criticism for its limited variety and scheduling issues. While there are several yoga classes available, many patrons lament the absence of popular formats found at other locations. The atmosphere is generally welcoming, with friendly staff and instructors, but management issues, including policies that some members find unfair, have created a cliquish and unwelcoming environment. The studio's cleanliness is often praised, but persistent odors and disorganization have detracted from the experience for some users. Moreover, the management's approach to customer service has been described as unprofessional, leading to dissatisfaction regarding membership cancellations and promotions unrelated to yoga.
