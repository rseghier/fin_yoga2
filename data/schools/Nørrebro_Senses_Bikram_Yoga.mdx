However, the administrative management has faced criticism, especially regarding class reservations and check-ins. Members have reported experiences where their spots were given away despite arriving just before class time, leading to frustration. Additionally, while there are policies concerning cancellations, some members feel that the studio lacks accountability when it comes to honoring reservations, which creates a sense of unfairness among students. Overall, the quality of teaching is highlighted positively, but the administrative practices could benefit from improvement.
