# Studio Presentation

This yoga studio features a large ground floor space segmented by curtains for changing and personal belongings, although it lacks lockers. While the yoga classes are well-taught and appreciated for their comprehensive approach, some attendees have expressed disappointment about the studio's appearance compared to advertised photos, noting discrepancies in flooring and visible pipes. The ambiance has been described as somewhat 'cool' with a preference for a warmer atmosphere created by candles or special lighting, which some find lacking. Additionally, the space can become crowded during popular classes, resulting in limited personal space. Overall, while the teaching quality is highly regarded, some improvements in facilities and ambiance are suggested.
